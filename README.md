# Tittle: P-2-Retail-Analytics-Data-Modernization
 "Hybrid Retail Data Modernization and Cloud Migration Platform"

Problem:
"A retail supply Chain dataset track the product movement, orders and sales performance from manufactured to end customer: Multiple Pipeline were failed every night 
No automation for monitoring data received once in a week due to data analytics team analyze blindly and assume no accurate data

Overview
Designed and Implement a hybrid retail data platform integrating on-prem ERP,POS and supply chain system with azure cloud service for centerlized analytics scalable processing and enterprises reporting . Build modern data pipeline and cloud based transformation frameworks enabling efficient reporting and operational Insight

HOW TO RUN (the important one)
   Step-by-step commands:
      python src/bronze/ingest.py
      python src/silver/clean.py
      python src/gold/transform.py
      python src/run_pipeline.py

RESULTS (numbers - from Day 10)
   Before/after optimization numbers, row counts,
   flagged transactions found. NUMBERS make it strong.

   CHALLENGES & TRADE-OFFS (honest)
   -The numeric columns like sales and Quanity data rows store string type dificult to calculate then to_cast(Double) to convert the data type from string to numeric float
   - create quarantine folder to store  irrelevant data like negative transaction amount invalid data null values
   "The pipeline was slow because it looped row by
   row; I fixed it with vectorization, cutting runtime
   from 27s to 3s."
